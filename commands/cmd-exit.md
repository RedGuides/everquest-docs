# /exit

## Syntax

<!--cmd-syntax-start-->
```eqcommand
/exit
```
<!--cmd-syntax-end-->

## Description

<!--cmd-desc-start-->
Immediately exit you from the game. 

The [/quit](cmd-quit.md) command provides identical functionality. The command must be typed in its entirety; partial commands are not accepted.
<!--cmd-desc-end-->

!!! note "Note: your character will still be in an active state, meaning they can still die, until the server logs them out a few minutes later."
