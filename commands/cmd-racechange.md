# /racechange

## Syntax

<!--cmd-syntax-start-->
```eqcommand
/racechange
```
<!--cmd-syntax-end-->

## Description

<!--cmd-desc-start-->
Change your character's race if you've purchased a Transmogrification Scroll from the [marketplace](cmd-marketplace.md).
<!--cmd-desc-end-->

!!! note "Special Notes"
    Changing your race will cause your quest journal to be cleared of all uncompleted quests, your deity specific spells to be removed from your spellbook (if you change your deity), and your bind location will be changed to the Plane of Knowledge. Any race specific equipment that you can no longer use will stay equipped but will no longer give any benefits.
