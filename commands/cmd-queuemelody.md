# /queuemelody

## Syntax

<!--cmd-syntax-start-->
```eqcommand
/queuemelody <song> [song]...
```
<!--cmd-syntax-end-->

## Description

<!--cmd-desc-start-->
Arranges a series of songs to be executed based on priority. This command is similar to [/melody](cmd-melody.md) except it plays songs in priority order depending on the song's recast time, your current buffs, and your target's current debuffs. The earlier a song is in the list, the higher priority it is.
<!--cmd-desc-end-->
