# /aggrometer

## Syntax

<!--cmd-syntax-start-->
```eqcommand
/aggrometer
```
<!--cmd-syntax-end-->

## Description

<!--cmd-desc-start-->
Toggles the Aggro Meter window. The window displays your current percentage of hate compared to the entity that is most hated by the NPC that is the focus of the meter. By default, this shows your current target, but the current aggro target can also be locked with [/aggrolock](cmd-aggrolock.md) so that it won't change when you change your current target.
<!--cmd-desc-end-->

## Examples

!!! quote "From a dev on the [EverQuest Forums](https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/game-update-notes-rain-of-fear.1785/):"

    - The new Aggro Meter displays your current percentage of hate compared to the entity that is most hated by the NPC that is the focus of the meter. By default, this shows your current target, but the current aggro target can also be locked so that it won't change when you change your current target.  
    - The meter can be toggled open and closed using the EQ button, /aggrometer, or by assigning a key binding to it.  
    - Aggro meter displays can be toggled in the Player, Group, Target, and Extended Target Window using the right click menu for each window.  
    - Added the ability to set the low, warning, and most hated colors for the aggro ratings. By default they are green, yellow, and red for low, warning, and most hated.  
    - Added the slash command /aggrolock that functions just like "Set Aggro Target" on the Aggro Meter.
