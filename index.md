# EverQuest

<!--desc-start-->
EverQuest is a long-running MMORPG with an '80s fantasy-cover aesthetic. While released in 1999, it remains relevant in the genre by offering slower-paced combat, classes with vastly differing gameplay, and decades worth of content and events. The commercial version, known as "live", is run by [DarkPaw Games](https://www.darkpawgames.com/home), and the emulated version is maintained by [EQEmulator](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server). **This page is for the live version.**
